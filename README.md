# Cric-ML 🏏

Cric-ML is a cricket analytics and machine learning project built using ball-by-ball data stored in a MySQL database.  
The project is currently in its **initial development stage** and focuses on structured data analysis, visualization, and future prediction use cases.

---

## 🚧 Project Status (Initial Stage)

- This project is in the **early phase**
- Currently, **only a limited number of matches** have been added to the database
- The purpose at this stage is:
  - To design a clean database schema
  - To validate analytics logic
  - To build reliable player, team, and phase-wise insights

The current notebooks and visualizations are based on this **partial dataset**.

---

## 📊 Current Capabilities

- Player-based analytics (runs, strike rate, dot balls, boundaries)
- Phase-wise analysis (Powerplay, Middle, Death overs)
- Team performance analysis
- Bowling analytics (economy, wickets, pressure)
- Match flow visualizations
- ML-ready feature exploration

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

### Phase 1: IPL 2025 Full Data Integration
- Add **complete IPL 2025 ball-by-ball data** to the database
- Re-run and validate all analytics on full-season data
- Improve feature reliability and coverage

### Phase 2: T20 World Cup 2026 Prediction
- Use IPL 2025 data as a major training source
- Build models to:
  - Predict match outcomes
  - Analyze player impact
  - Evaluate team strengths
- Apply the trained models to **T20 World Cup 2026** scenarios

### Phase 3: IPL 2026 Prediction
- Combine:
  - IPL 2025 data
  - T20 World Cup 2026 insights
- Use both datasets to:
  - Predict IPL 2026 performance
  - Compare player form across tournaments
  - Improve long-term prediction accuracy

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- MySQL
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `notebooks/` → Analysis and visualization notebooks  
- `src/` → Placeholder for future production-level code  
- `screenshots/` → Output visualizations (to be added later)  

---

## ⚠️ Note

Since the project is in its early stage and the dataset is partial,  
**all insights and trends are exploratory**, not final conclusions.

---

## 📌 Goal

To evolve Cric-ML from an analytics-focused project into a **robust cricket prediction system** using real-world T20 datasets.
